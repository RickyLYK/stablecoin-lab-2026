/// @title Ex6 — invariant testing
/// @notice Every test so far set up a situation and then checked the result. Invariant
///         testing flips that around: let the machine call operations randomly and
///         repeatedly, then ask "no matter how it thrashes, does this property still
///         hold?"
///
///         That is what a stablecoin should be tested like — you will never guess the
///         order an attacker does things in.
///
///         Acceptance: make exercise (it should be red until you are finished)
///
/// @dev How it works: Foundry picks functions from the handler at random, picks random
///      arguments, and calls them N times in a row; after each round it runs every
///      invariant_* function. The first failed assertion is a counterexample.
